  lyrics: `Poems are bullshit unless they areTeeth or trees or lemons piledOn a step. Or black ladies dyingOf men leaving nickel heartsBeating them down. Fuck poemsAnd they are useful, would they shootCome at you, love what you are,Breathe like wrestlers, or shudderStrangely after peeing. We want liveWords of the hip world live flesh &amp;Coursing blood. Hearts BrainsSouls splintering fire. We want poemsLike fists beating niggers out of JocksOr dagger poems in the slimy belliesOf the owner-jews. Black poems toSmear on girdlemamma mulatto bitchesWhose brains are red jelly stuckBetween 'lizabeth taylor's toes. StinkingWhores! we want "poems that kill."Assassin poems, Poems that shootGuns. Poems that wrestle cops into alleysAnd take their weapons leaving them deadWith tongues pulled out and sent to Ireland. KnockoffPoems for dope selling wops or slick halfwhitePoliticians Airplane poems, rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrRrrrrrrrrrrrrrr . . .tuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuh. . .rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr . . . Setting fire and death toWhities ass. Look at the LiberalSpokesman for the jews clutch his throat&amp; puke himself into eternity . . . rrrrrrrrThere's a negroleader pinned toA bar stool in Sardi's eyeballs meltingIn hot flame Another negroleaderOn the steps of the white house oneKneeling between the sheriff's thighsNegotiating coolly for his people.Aggh . . . stumbles across the room . . .Put it on him, poem! Strip him nakedTo the world! Another bad poem crackingSteel knuckles in a jewlady's mouthPoem scream poison gas on beasts in green beretsClean out the world for virtue and love,Let there be no love poems writtenUntil love can exist freely andCleanly. Let Black people understandThat they are the lovers and the sonsOf warriors and sonsOf warriors Are poems &amp; poets &amp;All the loveliness here in the worldADVERTISING We want a black poem. And aBlack World.Let the world be a Black PoemAnd Let All Black People Speak This PoemSilentlyOr LOUD`
