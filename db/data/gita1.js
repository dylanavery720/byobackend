  lyrics: `DHRITIRASHTRARanged thus for battle on the sacred plain--On Kurukshetra--say, Sanjaya! sayWhat wrought my people, and the Pandavas?SANJAYAWhen he beheld the host of Pandavas,Raja Duryodhana to Drona drew,And spake these words: "Ah, Guru! see this line,How vast it is of Pandu fighting-men,Embattled by the son of Drupada,Thy scholar in the war! Therein stand rankedChiefs like Arjuna, like to Bhima chiefs,Benders of bows; Virata, Yuyudhan,Drupada, eminent upon his car,Dhrishtaket, Chekitan, Kasi's stout lord,Purujit, Kuntibhoj, and Saivya,With Yudhamanyu, and UttamaujSubhadra's child; and Drupadi's;-all famed!All mounted on their shining chariots!On our side, too,--thou best of Brahmans! seeExcellent chiefs, commanders of my line,Whose names I joy to count: thyself the first,Then Bhishma, Karna, Kripa fierce in fight,Vikarna, Aswatthaman; next to theseStrong Saumadatti, with full many moreValiant and tried, ready this day to dieFor me their king, each with his weapon grasped,Each skilful in the field. Weakest-meseems-Our battle shows where Bhishma holds command,And Bhima, fronting him, something too strong!Have care our captains nigh to Bhishma's ranksPrepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!"Then, at the signal of the aged king,With blare to wake the blood, rolling aroundLike to a lion's roar, the trumpeterBlew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it,Trumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and hornsBurst into sudden clamour; as the blastsOf loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed!Then might be seen, upon their car of goldYoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,Krishna the God, Arjuna at his side:Krishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conchCarved of the "Giant's bone;" Arjuna blewIndra's loud gift; Bhima the terrible--Wolf-bellied Bhima-blew a long reed-conch;And Yudhisthira, Kunti's blameless son,Winded a mighty shell, "Victory's Voice;"And Nakula blew shrill upon his conchNamed the "Sweet-sounding," Sahadev on hisCalled"Gem-bedecked," and Kasi's Prince on his.Sikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn,Virata, Satyaki the Unsubdued,Drupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!)Long-armed Subhadra's children, all blew loud,So that the clangour shook their foemen's hearts,With quaking earth and thundering heav'n.Then 'twas-Beholding Dhritirashtra's battle set,Weapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the warInstant to break-Arjun, whose ensign-badgeWas Hanuman the monkey, spake this thingTo Krishna the Divine, his charioteer:"Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open groundBetwixt the armies; I would see more nighThese who will fight with us, those we must slayTo-day, in war's arbitrament; for, sure,On bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain,Obeying Dhritirashtra's sinful son."Thus, by Arjuna prayed, (O Bharata!)Between the hosts that heavenly CharioteerDrove the bright car, reining its milk-white steedsWhere Bhishma led,and Drona,and their Lords."See!" spake he to Arjuna, "where they stand,Thy kindred of the Kurus:" and the PrinceMarked on each hand the kinsmen of his house,Grandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons,Cousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixedWith friends and honoured elders; some this side,Some that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed,Such kith grown enemies-Arjuna's heartMelted with pity, while he uttered this:ADVERTISING ARJUNAKrishna! as I behold, come here to shedTheir common blood, yon concourse of our kin,My members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth,A shudder thrills my body, and my hairBristles with horror; from my weak hand slipsGandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burnsMy skin to parching; hardly may I stand;The life within me seems to swim and faint;Nothing do I foresee save woe and wail!It is not good, O Keshav! nought of goodCan spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hateTriumph and domination, wealth and ease,Thus sadly won! Aho! what victoryCan bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoilsCould profit; what rule recompense; what spanOf life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood?Seeing that these stand here, ready to die,For whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased,And power grew precious:-grandsires, sires, and sons,Brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law,Elders and friends! Shall I deal death on theseEven though they seek to slay us? Not one blow,O Madhusudan! will I strike to gainThe rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much lessTo seize an earthly kingdom! Killing theseMust breed but anguish, Krishna! If they beGuilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths;Their sins will light on us, if we shall slayThose sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin;What peace could come of that, O Madhava?For if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath,These cannot see, or will not see, the sinOf kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain,How should not we, who see, shun such a crime--We who perceive the guilt and feel the shame--O thou Delight of Men, Janardana?By overthrow of houses perishethTheir sweet continuous household piety,And-rites neglected, piety extinct--Enters impiety upon that home;Its women grow unwomaned, whence there springMad passions, and the mingling-up of castes,Sending a Hell-ward road that family,And whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath.Nay, and the souls of honoured ancestorsFall from their place of peace, being bereftOf funeral-cakes and the wan death-water. [FN#1]So teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slayKinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,Ahovat! what an evil fault it were!Better I deem it, if my kinsmen strike,To face them weaponless, and bare my breastTo shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow.So speaking, in the face of those two hosts,Arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat,And let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.`
