  lyrics: `little dark girl withkind eyeswhen it comes time touse the knifeI won't flinch andI won't blameyou,as I drive along the shore aloneas the palms wave,the ugly heavy palms,as the living does not arriveas the dead do not leave,I won't blame you,insteadI will remember the kissesour lips raw with loveand how you gave meeverything you hadand how Ioffered you what was left ofme,and I will remember your small roomthe feel of youthe light in the windowyour recordsyour booksour morning coffeeour noons our nightsour bodies spilled togethersleepingthe tiny flowing currentsimmediate and foreveryour leg my legyour arm my armyour smile and the warmthof youwho made me laughagain.little dark girl with kind eyesyou have noknife. the knife ismine and I won't use ityet.`
